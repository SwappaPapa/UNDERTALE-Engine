Created in Game Maker Studio 2.
Only contains code for:
Player (overworld) movements, and Collisions (specific object designated to this).
Code is "stolen" from this tutorial series: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnfQo32ME5g&list=PL14Yj-e2sgzySnBUlQLhq2VJXRLi66gFf 
ðŸ™ƒ
That is all code-wise.
Other important sprites still need to be added (e.g., the SAVE point).
Project is missing MANY sound effects, and the settings for sound effects are NOT FINAL.
